### ansible - roles

#### Role scaffolding

Another simple way to build the scaffolding for a role is to use the command:
```
ansible-galaxy init <role_name>
```

Running this command creates an example role in the current working directory, which you can modify to suit your needs. Using the init command also ensures the role is structured correctly in case you want to someday contribute the role to Ansible Galaxy.
